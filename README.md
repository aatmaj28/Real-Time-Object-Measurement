# Real-Time-Object-Measurment
My project focuses on real-time object measurement using computer vision and Python. By employing computer vision techniques, it enables precise and instant measurement of objects in real-time. This project offers valuable applications in various domains, providing accurate measurements for different objects as they are detected in real-time.
